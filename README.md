<h2> 📌this project Done Using Matlab Software.</h2> 
<h3> 🌟 This is a simple project that aimed to cover the concept of normal amplitude modulation and how to demodulate this signal using envelop concept through MATLAB software in plotting the given signal. Also, in this project the optimum value of the time constant that minimizes the mean square error between modulated signal and the output signal of the envelope detector was calculated using MATLAB Software.</h3>
